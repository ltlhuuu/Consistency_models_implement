A general purpose training and inference library for Consistency Models introduced in the paper ["Consistency Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01469) by OpenAI.

Consistency Models are a new family of generative models that achieve high sample quality without adversarial training. They support fast one-step generation by design, while still allowing for few-step sampling to trade compute for sample quality. They also support zero-shot data editing, like image inpainting, colorization, and super-resolution, without requiring explicit training on these tasks.

> **Note**: The library is the code base for implementing consistency models. It can be used to train all kinds of consistency models.
